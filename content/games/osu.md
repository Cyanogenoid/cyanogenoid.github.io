[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) is a rhythm game where you click circles to the beat.
I started playing in 2011, peaking at a rank of #629 out of a few million players.

Here is a more recent play from early 2020.

This play used to be #1 in 2016 for over a year, but it has since been beaten several times.

The "Easy" modifier makes circles appear much more in advance, which greatly increases how many circles are shown at the same time.
Ironically, this tends to make things much more difficult than normal.
