[Asakura! P](https://www.dlsite.com/eng/work/=/product_id/RE083661.html) is an obscure 2d platformer with action, puzzle, and metroidvania elements.
I hold the speedrun world records in the [any% category](https://www.speedrun.com/asakurap#Any)  (beat the game as fast as possible) and [100% category](https://www.speedrun.com/asakurap#100) (collect everything as fast as possible).

For planning the route for the 100% run, I wrote [various tools](https://github.com/Cyanogenoid/asakura-p-routing).
One of them uses the Z3 SMT solver to figure out the optimal order of each section in the second half of the run.
