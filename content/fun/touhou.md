Touhou is a series of bullet hell shoot-em-ups.

First, I [completed](https://twitter.com/Cyanogenoid/status/1237535881474396160) Touhou 14.3 \~ Impossible Spell Card.

Then I beat the Extra stage of Touhou 6 \~ Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.

While practicing for the much harder Lunatic mode of Touhou 6, I captured (no-hit no-bomb) the final attack of the last boss.

# Music

I'm a huge fan of [凋叶棕](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/%E5%87%8B%E5%8F%B6%E6%A3%95) (Diao ye zong), a group that does vocal and instrumental arranges of Touhou music.
They like to use `la` in lyrics to "censor" out references to dark or disturbing things such as death.
I made a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQzlnGe11joF6zn87SE-tCoEX_WhUC-A-0k5W3Bl7Ww/edit?usp=sharing) that counts every instance of these `la`'s.
